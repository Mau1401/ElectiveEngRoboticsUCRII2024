# Elective Introdoction to Robotics Engineering UCR IISemester 2024
## Course Description:
This course introduces the fundamental principles, components, modeling, and design of autonomous mobile and industrial robotic systems, along with their basic applications in industrial and commercial settings. Key topics include localization, navigation, path planning, and obstacle avoidance for autonomous mobile robots. For industrial robots, the course covers concepts such as workspace, trajectory planning, redundancy, control modes, end effectors, and object manipulation and gripping. The goal is to develop and implement basic control algorithms that ensure accurate movement control of these robotic platforms.

The course builds on foundational knowledge from previous subjects in the program, such as Signals and Systems II, Control Systems, Probabilistic Models of Signals and Systems, Physics/Mechanics, Electronics, Programming with Open Platforms, and Electrical Machines. It also introduces more advanced robotics concepts that will be useful for future specialized courses and potential industry and commercial applications.

## General Objective:
By the end of the course, students will be able to analyze and understand the fundamentals of autonomous mobile and industrial robotic systems. They will use mathematical models and computational tools to design, modify, evaluate, simulate, tune, and parameterize these systems effectively.
